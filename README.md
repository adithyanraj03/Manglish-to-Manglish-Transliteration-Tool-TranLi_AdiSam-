## 🧠 How It Works

TranLi_AdiSam uses a character-by-character processing approach:

1. It breaks down Malayalam text into constituent parts: vowels, consonants, compounds, and modifiers.
2. Each character or combination is mapped to its Manglish equivalent using predefined dictionaries.
3. Special rules handle compound characters and modifiers to ensure accurate phonetic representation.
4. The tool processes text word by word for efficient and accurate transliteration.
